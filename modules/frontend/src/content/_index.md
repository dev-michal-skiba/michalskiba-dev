# About Me

I am a passionate backend developer with solid experience in building robust and efficient web applications. Currently, I am exploring web application security and cloud solutions to enhance my expertise in building secure and scalable systems.

# Idea Behind This Site

This blog serves as my portfolio, where I share what I'm learning about web security. I write posts and create demos that explain popular web attacks and how to defend against them. This hands-on work also allows me to gain practical experience with cloud technologies by building, testing, and securing applications. Explore my projects to see my skills in action.
