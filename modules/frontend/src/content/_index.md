Welcome to my portfolio page! I'm Micha≈Ç Skiba, a professional Python web developer and 
computer science enthusiast. I created this page to showcase my skills. I decided to
make it a blog about web security. Throughout this blog you can explore posts about
potential vulnerabilities that a web page can have. What's more, I always provide live
demonstration that you can access online and where you check the vulnerability yourself.
This blog is not targeted for people who want to see beautiful cutting-edge UI, because
I specialize at backend part of web applications, so don't expect this blog to become
piece of art :)
